# About this project
This is a Conway's Game of Life implementation using React.js
You can set your initial state of the game and hit start and it will continue showing you the result of each generation.

# How to use
Have Node.js installed on your system and add it to your `path` variable. Then run `npm start` to run it on a port on your device or use `npm build` to make a static build bundle for deployment.

# Acknowledgments
I made this is a learning initiative and was inspired by [Ben Awad](https://github.com/benawad/react-conway-game-of-life)'s solution for the problem.
